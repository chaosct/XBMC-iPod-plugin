XBMC-iPod-Plugin

=================

A [XBMC](http://xbmc.org/) plugin to browse and play songs of your iPod (on Linux at this moment)

Features
--------

Currently, it basically lists your connected iPods, then your albums (no artwork atm) and finally the album songs that you can play.

It crashes sometimes (on my machine, but I don't know why atm; wanna help me?)

Installation
------------

Just install it as any other plugin: zip it in a folder named plugin.audio.ipod and install in XBMC.

You will need the libgpod library and python bindings (on ubuntu: apt-get install python-gpod)
